# ProjectPlanHtmlLinux.cms

Paratext includes a way display Project Plans as HTML, but the existing scripts
assume a Windows OS. These files add an entry to the Project Menu:
> "Personalization Tools" > "Admin" > "Show Project Plan Html (Linux)"

This script imports from Mike Herchenroeder's `ProjectPlanHtml.py` and liberally
reuses content that couldn't be imported from other files. His scripts should
be considered a prerequisite for these based on the current structure.

These could be cleanly separated out from Mike's scripts, but ideally the two
would instead be integrated together into one set.
